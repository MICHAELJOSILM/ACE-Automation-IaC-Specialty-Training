SCRIPTS provide AUTOMATION
- Shell Scripts
- Python Scripts

DevOps goal is to increase organizations ability to delivery applications and services at high-speed with better quality and security
- CI/CD pipelines
  - **Continuous Integration** (CI) -> whenever a developer checks in code to the source repository, a build is **automatically** triggered (Jenkins - extensible and lots of plug-in support)
  - **Continuous Delivery** (CD) -> Automates the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments. Every change is prove to be **deployable** at any time
    - still need to decided when to deploy
    - can be deployed in dev, test/staged, prod
  - CI/CD pipeline is the iterative process that automates software delivery using CI and CD
    - automated process with standardized feedback loops to developers 
    - change in source code repository triggers a notification to the CI/CD tool which runs CI/CD pipeline
      - build -> test -> deploy 
- Version Control Systems (VCS)
  - manage the lifecycle of files
  - Github, BitBucket, GitLab, Azure DevOps

Deploy infrastructure at scale using principles of DevOps

Use GitHub actions to create CI/CD pipeline

Cloud allows Developers to delivery applications and services with speed and agility.
DevOps is Networking teams responding with the same speed and agility that comes with deploying in the cloud.
